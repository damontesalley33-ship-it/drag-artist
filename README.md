<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
Football is my <strong>favorite sport</strong> — I grew up playing it and have always loved the game.
I was born in <em>Washington, D.C.</em>, and I’ve been living in Maryland ever since.
I have two siblings: one older and one younger. My <strong>favorite colors</strong> are blue and pink.
I'm really into <em>fashion</em> and care a lot about what I wear — style matters to me!
Currently, I'm a <strong>Computer Science major</strong> and I want to take the <em>software engineering</em> route in the future. My favorite rapper/artist is NBA youngboy
